					Hello! I am from Raleigh, North Carolina. I love to travel! I have been to several foreign countries like Spain, Chile, and, most recently, China! I like hiking and camping too. I am an artist and draw portraits and make cool dinosaur-themed prints. I am super excited about learning to code. I rencently decided to give up having a car as a commitment to riding my bike more and being more environmentally friendly and concious. My favorite bicycle shop is Oak City Cycling. Those guys are the best! If there's any more information you want to know about me, please feel free to contact me via the links below. Thanks!
